## 📑Context

### Project Collaboration

This project is a collaborative effort between Levuur and Tree Company. [Tree Company](https://treecompany.be) specializes in engaging and informing citizens on societal issues through digital solutions. Levuur, on the other hand, is an expert in participation and stakeholder management, designing and guiding tailored stakeholder processes for companies, governments, and organizations. Both Levuur and Tree Company are part of DBP Partners [DBP Partners](https://dbppartners.be), collaborating structurally in various projects.

### Project Overview

The collaboration is part of an international Erasmus+ project involving Levuur, Tree Company, the city of Sint-Niklaas (Belgium), DYPALL Network (Portugal), and Danes Je Nov Dan (Slovenia). The primary goal is to design a 'Phygital' tool that local governments and organizations can utilize to gather input from young people on policy issues relevant to them. The tool aims to provide a novel, accessible way for young people to express their views on policies to local authorities by combining physical and digital elements.

### Project Objectives

The main objective is to design a `Phygital` tool that meets the specified requirements and roles. The tool should be applicable to any organization seeking youth participation in decision-making processes. The standard case for testing involves the youth council of a municipality or city, engaging with young people about the upcoming local elections. Additionally, a second case, selected from your local context, should demonstrate the tool's versatility across various organizations.

### Roles and Users

Four distinct roles have been identified for the tool: Eindgebruiker (young participant), Begeleider (facilitator present during tool usage), Beheerder van een deelplatform (local government or organizational administrator managing projects), and Beheerders van het gehele platform (platform administrators like Tree Company and Levuur).

### Non-functional Requirements

The tool is expected to function in semi-public spaces like school halls, sports clubs, libraries, and community centers. Both guided and unguided usage scenarios need to be accommodated, requiring an attractive and intuitive design. The tool should cater to individual and group usage by young participants aged 17 to 25.

### Material and Technology

While a fully finished casing is not part of the task, the setup should be robust enough for testing in different locations. It must work with standard hardware and software across the EU, be easily set up and dismantled, transportable, made of durable materials, and cost-efficient. The web application should be compatible with common browsers, scalable, and coded for maintenance and future enhancements.

### Usability and Performance

Emphasis is placed on user-friendliness, engaging design, and performance meeting industry standards. The tool will undergo user tests to refine the design based on participant interactions. Performance, security, and testing standards must align with best practices.
